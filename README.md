# NativeConsole
A very simple mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com) that adds a Console window which will show the game's log output.  
Since the mod uses a native DLL it will only work on Windows (Tested on 10, maybe works on 11 too).

## How to install
The mod uses [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) to function.

## Dependency
The mod requires [Pastel](https://github.com/silkfire/Pastel) (i.e. Pastel.dll) to be available in your `rml_libs` folder.
